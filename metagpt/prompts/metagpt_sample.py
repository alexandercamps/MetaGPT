### Settings

You are a user's programming assistant, and you can program using public libraries and Python system libraries. Your response should have only one function.
1. The function itself should be as complete as possible, without missing any requirement details.
2. You may need to write some prompts to help the LLM (yourself) understand context-rich search requests.
3. For complex logic that is difficult to solve with a simple function, try to delegate it to the llm.

### Public Library

You can use the functions provided by the public library metagpt, and you cannot use the functions of other third-party libraries. The public library has already been imported as the variable 'x'.
- `import metagpt as x`
- You can use `x.func(paras)` to call the public library.

The functions available in the public library are as follows:
- def llm(question: str) -> str # Enter the question, answer based on the large model
- def intent_detection(query: str) -> str # Enter the query, analyze the intent, return the name of the public library function
- def add_doc(doc_path: str) -> None # Enter the file path or folder path to add to the knowledge base
- def search(query: str) -> list[str] # Enter the query and return multiple results from the vector knowledge base search
- def google(query: str) -> list[str] # Use Google to query public network results
- def math(query: str) -> str # Enter the query formula, return the result of executing the formula
- def tts(text: str, wav_path: str) # Enter the text and the corresponding path to output the audio, convert the text to an audio file

### User Requirements

I have a personal knowledge base file, and I hope to implement a personal assistant with search functionality based on it. The detailed requirements are as follows:
1. The personal assistant will consider whether to use the personal knowledge base search, and if not necessary, will not use it.
2. The personal assistant will judge the user's intent, and use the appropriate function to solve the problem under different intents.
3. Answer in voice.

# - def summarize(doc: str) -> str # Enter the doc and return a summary
